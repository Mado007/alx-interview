# 0x0A. Prime GameObjects

This repository contains the solution for the Prime Game project, a part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project aims to develop a program that determines the winner of a competitive game scenario involving prime numbers and game theory principles.

## Project Overview

### Description
In the Prime Game, players take turns choosing prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers, starting from 1 up to and including n. The chosen prime number and its multiples are removed from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. The project involves implementing a function to determine the winner of multiple rounds of the game.

### Concepts Covered
- Prime Numbers
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Game Theory
- Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- Python Programming

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`0-prime_game.py`**: Contains the implementation of the `isWinner` function, which determines the winner of the Prime Game.
- **`main_0.py`**: Sample usage of the `isWinner` function.
- **`README.md`**: Readme file providing project details, instructions, and guidelines.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alx-interview/0x0A-primegame.git
```

```bash
cd 0x0A-primegame
./main_0.py
```
